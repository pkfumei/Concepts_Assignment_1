An assignment for my undergrad Java course.
First draft.

Write a Java program that defines an array of size 20 
and assigns 20 different numbers to the array elements. 
The program then finds the highest number in the array, 
the lowest number, sum, average, and generates:

 
The highest number is
X
The lowest number is
Y
The sum is
Z
The average is
A
